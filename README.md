# Aircraft_Traffic_Controlled_System
# Introduction:
This java code involves leveraging our expertise in Object-Oriented Programming with Java to conceptualize and create an Airport Surface Traffic Control (ASTC) system. This system is engineered to oversee and regulate the intricate movements of aircraft, ensuring a secure and streamlined flow of traffic across taxiways, runways, and gates. Additional functionalities are detailed in the project's description, encompassing a comprehensive approach to aviation traffic management.
The primary objective of this endeavor was to test and enhance our understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, requiring a fusion of creativity and effective time management. Our collective aim was to tackle the complexities of developing an ASTC system, addressing the complications inherent in managing aircraft movements on the ground. This project served as a platform to showcase our proficiency in solving challenging engineering problems while nurturing our innovative thinking and ability to manage intricate tasks within specified timelines.
